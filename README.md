Understand the basics of LPP: Search Space, Solution Space Exploration

Repo contains 3 notebooks each explaining Linear Programming in an intuitive way.

1. Simplex Intuition - Helps understand how constraints work and objective space better
2. Primal Dual Relationships - Helps understand how primal and dual of a problem work and how they help prove optimality
3. MIP Branch and Bound - Helps understand how lp relaxation and branch and bound work
